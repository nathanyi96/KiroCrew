"""Dev Container support: run a session's kiro-cli inside the project's
devcontainer (VS Code parity).

When ``agent.devcontainer`` is ``"auto"`` and a session's work dir carries a
``.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`` (or ``.devcontainer.json``), the ACP spawn
path replaces the host kiro-cli argv with a ``docker exec`` into a container
built by the reference ``@devcontainers/cli`` — the same engine VS Code uses.
The repo's devcontainer.json is honored in full (image/build, features,
lifecycle hooks, mounts, runArgs) after a one-time per-config human trust
grant, mirroring VS Code's Workspace Trust model. The gateway does NOT strip
or override the file: parity, not a sandbox.

Architecture (mirrors VS Code's client/server split):
  - gateway stays on the host (UI plane);
  - kiro-cli is executed INSIDE the container (execution plane), like
    vscode-server. Verified necessary: kiro-cli 2.14 executes shell/file
    tools in-process and ignores the ACP client fs/terminal capabilities,
    so the process itself must move.
  - the workspace is bind-mounted by the devcontainer CLI; the ACP
    ``session/new`` cwd uses the container-side workspace folder.

Trust model: the SHA-256 of the effective devcontainer.json must be granted
by a dashboard user before any build or exec. Config edits invalidate trust
(hash mismatch → re-prompt), matching VS Code's re-prompt on change.

Container reuse: one container per project directory, keyed by an id-label,
reused across sessions and gateway restarts (``devcontainer up`` is
idempotent for an unchanged config).

Known v1 limitations (documented in docs/devcontainers.md):
  - Kiro Crew's own managed MCP servers (mcp-core/cron/computer) are not
    reachable from inside the container (their REST callback targets the
    gateway's host loopback). kiro-cli reports mcp_server_init_failure and
    the session continues with the project toolchain fully functional.
  - /proc-based liveness observes the host-side ``docker exec`` client
    proxy: death detection works (pipe close), wedge heuristics degrade.
  - Linux hosts only. On macOS, Docker Desktop is a VM; the existing
    Seatbelt sandbox path is unchanged.

    * ``dockerComposeFile`` is different in both directions. It resolves against
      the CONFIG FILE's directory rather than the workspace (the CLI's own path
      helper takes ``configFilePath`` as the base, confirmed by a fixture where a
      compose file present ONLY beside the sanitized copy resolved fine), and a

      binds against the compose file's own directory, and freezing MOVES the file

      ``memswap_limit`` is pinned to ``mem_limit`` because otherwise the kernel

    Moving kiro-cli into the container moves it away from the Kiro home state it
    needs. Agent definitions are looked up as FILES, and kiro-cli resolves
    ``--agent`` against ``$PWD/.kiro/agents`` before ``~/.kiro/agents``, so the two
    locations differ sharply once containerized:

    * a **project-scoped** definition (``<project>/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``) sits

      unchanged;
    * a **global** one (``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``) is host-only machine state
      that no ordinary image carries, so startup would fail as a generic ACP init
      error with no hint that a missing agent file was the cause.

    Refusing here with the fix in the message mirrors the kiro-cli preflight
    rather than silently falling back to the host: an invisible fallback leaves the
    operator believing a session is containerized when it is not, and a wrong
    belief about where code runs is worse than a clear refusal.

    The host's ``~/.kiro/agents`` is deliberately NOT bind-mounted to paper over
